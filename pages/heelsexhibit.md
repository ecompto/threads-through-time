# Ouch! My Toes!
We all know the story of Cinderella and her glass slipper, and how its loss and discovery represents a beautiful transformation from servant girl to princess. But do we know how the high heeled design of her glass slipper came to be?

While high heels are associated considerably with femineity, they were originally designed for men in the 10th century to be used when riding on horseback. Later in France during the 17th century they would also become a status symbol to men, showcasing their wealth, and making their wearers taller and thus more visually powerful.

When female aristocrats in France also began to wear heels, their structure was significantly redesigned to be more petite, changing women’s silhouette’s to be more desirable, making them appear taller and thinner while pushing out both their chest and butt. With this redesign, a woman’s weight was redistributed primarily to the balls of her feet, and with their toes pinched by pointed designs, heels signified that the wearer was wealthy enough to not have to walk, as walking in heels for long periods of time was painful.

Up until the 19th century, heels were regulated to the rich and ruling classes who sported frivolous and ornately decorated pairs of heels for every event. But as materials became more accessible thanks to the industrial revolution more classes of women began to own and wear heels despite their discomfort.

### Heels during the 20th century
Seen as the height of femininity, heels became part of the female dress code, worn for social events and as part of the female work uniform. During the Roaring 20s, with all the glitz and glam, heels were frivolously decorated and often showcased cutouts and straps to show off as much skin as possible. This was in direct contrast to the late 19th, early 20th century previous styles of high lace up boots that were seen as modest. Throughout the course of the 20th century the design of heels changed drastically, swinging like a pendulum between short and tall, plain and extravagant, as economies rose and fell and as women became a greater part of the workforce. Some of the most common types of heels were created during this time: Stiletto’s, Pumps, and Platforms.

#### Stilettos
Stilettos were usually 3” in height and were characterized by their iconic slim heel and pointed toe. Stilettos were the most prominent heel design of the 20th century, considered to be the classic height that gave women the elegant and slimming posture they saw in the media. While iconic, these types of heels were some of the most uncomfortable, pinching toes and making it difficult to walk.
#### Pumps
Pumps were characterized by their short squat heel often between 1 ½” and 2” in height and were the smallest heels worn in the 20th century. In the mid 1960’s these types of heels became quite popular and also began the transition from the pointed toe to a more square or rounded toe to accommodate for the natural structure of the toe box.
#### Platforms
Platform heels as we know them were popularized in the latter portion of the 20th century but have their roots in the early part of the century with low wedge heels accompanied by front platforms. Platforms were typically given to heels when they were 4” in height to make them more comfortable. Their design often varied with time but typically featured open toes and ankle straps.

### The Modern High Heel
For many the high heel is a construct imposed upon women to fit the male gaze, while others see them as a tool to improve their confidence. Regardless, most women acknowledge that they are painful to wear, pinching toes, altering posture, and even causing instability in knees and backs.

So why do we still wear them? Well, that depends on who you ask, but most agree that they feel they are a cultural tradition. Young girls grow up with dolls wearing heels, play dress-up in plastic princess themed heels, and see their mothers and other women put them on when they dress up. So when they grow up, they find themselves with heels of their own wearing them to formal events, to feel pretty, and to garner respect. It is unlikely that heels, despite their many detriments, will ever disappear so we might as well grab a cute pair and hope they don’t pinch our toes too badly.
