## About Threads Through Time

Threads Through Time is a digital archive prototype showcasing historical garments, textile patterns, and related archival materials. This archive features items from the Virgina Tech Costume and Textile Collection (VTCAT) that was founded by Miss Oris Glisson, a professor and department head at Virginia Tech, who donated over 600 fashionable dress items creating the hallmark collection of its holdings.

The VTCAT has over 5,000 items dating from the 18th century to present, including garments, accessories, and textiles from local and state donors with a focus on items owned by middle- and working-class individuals from southwestern Virginia. The primary goal of the VTCAT is to preserve and document fashionable dress items, and their significance to apparel design and changing societal values.

Threads Through Time as a digital prototype aims to meet those goals of the VTCAT including:
- Preserving and documenting fashionable dress items
- Researching and communicating how clothing changes in design to reflect societal and cultural values
- Fostering community through understanding local history
- Increasing access to the VTCAT holdings through digitization projects
- Providing students and researchers with opportunities to expand their knowledge related to artifact research, exhibition, historical fashion, textiles, etc.

Threads Through Time features 27 unique items selected from the digitized selection of VTCAT items representing a variety of garments and accessories dated throughout the 20th century. Check out our featured exhibition “Ouch! My Toes” about high heels and their role in society through time.
