## Meet The Creators
### Ella Compton
Ella is a senior MSIS student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville working on this prototype archive as part of her Digital Libraries course. While not an experienced cataloger, Ella has a strong interest in fashion design, historical clothing and costumes, and the roles clothing plays in defining a historical era. She has been sewing clothing and costumes since she was 10 and is very familiar with construction techniques, fabrics, and clothing styles. For this prototype Ella helped to select items for the collection, created the metadata and edited the code for the archive website, and contributed to writing the “About”, “Ouch! My Toes”, and the various other interpretive pages. 

### Andrew Snider
Andrew is a graduate student in the MSIS program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, working toward a career in School Libraries. He is very new to the world of digital collections and metadata, but excited to learn more through this project. Andrew chose the Virginia Tech Costume and Textile Collection because of his background in theatre and his interest in how clothing reflects different historical eras. For this prototype, he helped select items for the collection, explored the use of AI tools for metadata generation, applied standards and controlled vocabularies through AI prompts, and documented challenges encountered during the process.
