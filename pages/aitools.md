# Integration of AI Tools for Metadata Creation
One of the most challenging aspects of digital collection management is metadata creation, the descriptive information that enables searchability and discovery of individual items and collections as a whole. Traditionally metadata is manually curated, a process that can be time-consuming and complex particularly in the case of large or specialized collections like those in the Virginia Tech Costume and Textile Collection.

With the increased development of technology, AI has been seen as a potential tool for generating metadata in a more efficient way. As part of Threads Through Time, AI-driven metadata generation tools were explored and used to determine their effectiveness in automating the cataloging process.  

## AI Tools
OpenAI GPT-4 (ChatGPT), Google PaLM 2 (Bard), Claude 3 (Anthropic) were selected and compared against each other and manually generated metadata from items in the Threads Through Time collection. To better evaluate their effectiveness, similar prompts and the same items were used for each tool.

Overall, when testing each tool it was determined that the chosen prompts had the biggest impact on the success of metadata generation. When more structured prompts with specific requests were used, all 3 tools performed better providing rich and accurate metadata. In comparison, vague prompts often resulted in the generation of inconsistent fields or no fields at all.

## Summary of Differences in AI Tools
OpenAI (GPT-4) excels at generating rich, narrative descriptions, making metadata more engaging with visual and contextual details. It emphasizes storytelling and provides a deeper understanding of the objects' historical and material significance. Google PaLM 2 focuses on producing concise and factual metadata, prioritizing clarity and functionality overelaborate descriptions, while still ensuring all necessary fields are populated. Claude 3, like PaLM 2, produces efficient and structured metadata, with a more neutral and direct tone, ensuring the objectâ€™s key details are presented but with less narrative elaboration compared to GPT-4. Each platform offers unique strengths: GPT-4 for narrative depth, PaLM 2 for brevity and clarity, and Claude 3 for accuracy and directness.
